# restaurant-sentiment-analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on Yelp restaurant reviews, classifying them as positive or negative using text mining techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and sentiment lexicons (Bing Liu, NRC, AFINN). It also develops machine learning models to predict sentiment and evaluates model performance.

**Yelp Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis**

This project focuses on analyzing Yelp reviews for restaurants to classify them as either positive or negative based on the content of the review and its star rating. The goal is to gain insights into how sentiment can be extracted from user-generated text using a mix of traditional text mining techniques and machine learning models.

**Key aspects of the project:**
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We explore the distribution of reviews and star ratings, and look into how well the ratings align with the sentiments expressed in the review text.

**Sentiment Lexicons:** We use well-known sentiment lexicons like Bing Liu, NRC, and AFINN to identify words that indicate positive or negative sentiment in the reviews.

**Machine Learning Models:** We build several models, including Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to predict the sentiment of the reviews based on the words used in them.

**Text Processing:** The text data is cleaned and preprocessed using tokenization, stopword removal, and other text mining techniques to prepare it for model training.

**Model Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to understand how well they predict sentiment.


Overall, this project demonstrates how text mining and machine learning can be applied to understand the sentiment behind user reviews and make sense of large amounts of unstructured data.
